<h1>Takeaways for Week 6</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Data Security</h3>

<p class="counter">
The aim of the GDPR Master project is to create a realistic and concrete guidance for compliance with GDPR article 32 by analysing technical and legal perspectives of decisions regarding breach of security of data processing. They selected 30 fines, these fines were not randomly selected as different sizes of fines were selected, and also the diversity of countries was taken into account (18 European countries and the US). They created an ontology in which they included the most important aspects of the article 32, the ontology includes technical, general and legal characteristics of the fines. They found that the majority of the fines which they selected were digital data, 25 out of 30 fines were digital data while the remaining 5 fines were processing data. But they were interested in digital data where security measures could be applied. </p>

<h3>Relations and Rules</h3>

<p class="counter">
There are different types of hierarchical relations that describe hierarchical structures, for example, Instance — Class, Subclass — Superclass “generalization”, Part — Whole “aggregation”, and Owner — Owned. Generalization relation and Aggregation relation are both transitive relations. They both have a tree-like structure, but it is an and-tree in the aggregation relation while it is an or-tree in the generalization relation. In addition, The tree is an instance-tree in the aggregation relation while it is a class-tree in the generalization relation. There are some properties that relations can have such as the degree which means the number of arguments (for example , adding a date and a location for a specific relation). Other properties are cardinality which is the number of instances and symmetry (such relations are marriage and friend of). More properties are reflexivity, transitivity, inverse, and the domain and range of the relation. The limits of the OWL is that it expresses only binary and class relations, it doesn't include general rules as well ( such as if..then). </p>

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Moreau and Groth 2013</h3>

<p class="counter">
Moreau and Groth (2013) illustrate in their chapter the application of provenance technologies by choosing four use cases (from a wide range of use cases) to focus on. These four use cases are quality assessment, compliance, cataloging and reply. Provenance is the digital equivalent of a paper trail, it can provide sources of things by describing what occurred in a system. When expressing provenance, Entities are attributed to an Agent where articles, charts,data sets and web pages can be described as entities. While organizations and people can be presented by using Agent construct. Furthermore, Activities are used to describe what happened. A provenance graph contains edges that express certain views, for example, the responsibility view which provides information about who takes the responsibility for an action. Another view is the data flow view which describes the dependencies between data in a system. In addition, the process flow view describes the flow of operations. </p>

<h3>Baeza-Yates 2018</h3>

<p class="counter">
Bias is noticed in many and different aspects in human life. The remedy of the bias starts from enhancing the awareness that the bias exists [Baeza-Yates 2018]. Cultural biases affect people's beliefs while cognitive biases affect behaviours and decisions. The author addresses firstly the Activity bias which is a result of the way that people use the web and the hidden biases of people who do not have internet access. Moreover, the Activity bias has advantages and not just disadvantages, where it is useful for keeping the most used content on the web available. The author also addresses the data bias which influences algorithms by using machine learning methods, it is difficult to understand the effect which data bias has on algorithms since it is difficult to measure the bias. </p>
