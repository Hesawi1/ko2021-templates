<h1>Takeaways for Week 4</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Semantic Fire Fighting</h3>

<p class="counter">
The guest Van Leeuwen is a firefighter who is working with fire data to get advantages and new predictions through this data. The big question of this lecture was how AI can help in making predictions that can help provide smart decisions during a fire. However, Making predictions using AI techniques needs massive amounts of data which is not available as every fire is unique. Moreover, even if machine learning and AI can provide predictions, some unexpected fires will happen. The fire data at this moment is very poor as the firefighters are not trained to collect data. Van Leeuwen started a product called FireGraph which is a RDF knowledge graph that interlinks more than 16 databases, and gets real time incident data, shacl data shapes are created to support ML. Furthermore, machine learning models are used to discover buildings that have the same issues related to fire problems.

<h3>Controlled Natural Language</h3>

<p class="counter">
Controlled natural language is constructed from a certain natural language (such as English) to be more restrictive in using lexicon, syntax and/or semantics, but it still uses most of its natural properties. Controlled natural languages are used in different areas, for example, in semantic web and query interfaces. There are differences between natural languages (e.g. English) and formal languages (e.g. Propositional logic), where natural languages are more expressive, natural and complex than the formal languages, and formal languages are more precise and simpler than natural languages. ACE is a controlled Natural language which has an automatic and unambiguous translation into first-order logic. ACE is used in different areas such as ontology editors, rule systems and general reasoners. Some features that ACE has are disjunction (or), conjunction (and), negation (not), if-then, and nested expressions. Other features also include anaphoric references ( e.g. pronouns), quantifiers (e.g.every), and content words (e.g. nouns). </p>

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Horrocks 2008</h3>

<p class="counter">
Horrocks (2008) describes in this paper the technologies used in the semantic web in order to make the software agents able to understand the information being presented. The main goal of Semantic Web is to allow sharing and processing data in an effective way automatically by tools, and manually as well. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is one of these technologies, where RDF is a language that provides descriptions for the web resources and the relationships among them by using internationalized resource identifiers (IRIs). However, RDF is not enough for creating the Semantic Web as it has limits such as describing constraints and conjunctions. In 2004, the OWL ontology language emerged as a result of the need for a more expressive language. A key feature of OWL is that it depends in its basis on the description logic; this enables OWL for reasoning and knowledge inferences. Semantic Web research plays an important role in the development of Semantic Web technologies.

<h3>Heath and Bizer 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Heath and Bizer (2011) focus in their introduction chapter on the approaches that can make the data more discoverable and reusable. To make the data reusable, it should be well-structured as well-structured data enables people to create reliable tools to reuse these data. One approach that can be used for the aim of creating structured data is Microformats, which can describe data using html pages. However, Microformats are not an efficient approach for sharing arbitrary data on the web, because Microformats can provide a small set of attributes that can describe a small set of entities, and it can not express the relationships between these entities. Web APIs are another approach for creating structured data, But it is not an efficient approach as well, because data is hard to access and discover. Heath and Bizar (2011) mention linked data as a solution that enables discovering, accessing and reusing data, where linked data is provided with RDF that can describe things and the relationships between these things.</p>

<h3>Miller 1995</h3>

<p class="counter">
Miller (1995) describes the lexical database WordNet which combines the traditional lexicographic information and modern computing in order to act as a dictionary. In WordNet, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are categorized in sets of synonyms, and these synonyms sets are linked through semantic relations. language is defined as a set of pairs W which contains form and sense, where form presents the word and sense presents the set of meanings. There are more than 118000 forms and 90000 senses contained in WordNet, 17% of the words are polysemous (have more than one meaning) and 40 % of the words have one or more synonyms. The semantic relations that are used in WordNet are: Synonymy, Antonymy, Hyponymy, Meronymy, Troponymy, Entailment.  A further development of WordNet can be: allowing the program to evaluate the word context in order to provide the best meaning of that word. </p>

<h3>Kumar et al. 2013</h3>

<p class="counter">
Kumar et al. (2013) describe in their paper the principles of design mining, and how the data mining and knowledge discovery techniques transformed the design of web pages. They demonstrate that using knowledge discovery techniques in Web design data enable users to understand design demographics, automate design curation, and support new data-driven design interactions. Webzeitgeist is a software platform for web design mining and machine learning, its architecture depends on four principles which are scalability, extensibility, completeness and consistency. Moreover, they discuss the implementation of Webzeitgeist where it includes five integrated components which are Web crawler (adds web pages to the Webzeitgeist repository), the proxy server (identify and store a pageâ€™s resources), the data store  (includes NoSQL database and SQL database ), the post-process (a set of post-processes are run when a page is downloaded and converted to a DOM, rendered, and store) , and the API (through which Clients access the Webzeitgeist repository).</p>
