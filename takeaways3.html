<h1>Takeaways for Week 3</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<p class="counter">
There are different logic formalisms, some popular formalisms are propositional logic, Syllogisms, Description Logics(which is used in the semantic web language owl), First-order logic and Higher-order logic. There also exist different notation types for these logic formalisms, these notation types are Mathematical/formal notations(which are used in computer science), Graphical notations and Natural language notations. Syllogisms are the oldest logic form among the other mentioned forms, it consists of three statements, the third one is the conclusion which follows the first and the second statement. There are some trade-offs among the logic formalisms in terms of expressivity and decidability, for example, the first-order logic is expressive while the syllogisms are very inexpressive. First-order logic can be used to achieve tasks that are related to question answering, and to check consistency.

<h3>Ontologies</h3>

<p class="counter">
Many different types of concepts help in organizing the world around us, they can be used to recognize something and to test the reality. There exist three ways to describe a concept, it can be described by using a symbol which is a linguistic label, or by giving an intentional definition, or by giving an existential view such as examples. An ontology in IT is the consensual and formal description of shared concepts in a domain. Basic-level categories are the prime categories which people use, building a hierarchy can be done by giving these categories abstract names and subtypes. When building a hierarchy, the basic-level classes are in the middle of the hierarchy, where the higher levels will be the abstract names and the lower levels will be the subtypes. Examples of common ontologies are: Friend of a Friend, Agent identity, Dublin Core and WordNet.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Gensler 2010</h3>

<p class="counter">
Gensler (2010) explains in the introduction chapter the concept of logic. Logic means reasoning and separating good from bad reasoning by analysing and evaluating arguments. Logic can be considered as a tool which can enhance the understanding of philosophical reasoning. The term ”argument” in logic expresses a set of statements which consists of premises and conclusion. An argument is valid when it is impossible for all premises to be true and the conclusion false. The validity of an argument tells nothing about its premises. A sound argument is a valid argument and all of its premises are true. Criticizing an argument can be through showing that it is unsound by proving that one of its premises is false, or by proving that the conclusion does not follow.

<h3>Odell 1994</h3>

<p class="counter">
Odell (1994) describes in their paper six different ways of composition, which is an approach to form a whole object using different objects to be its parts. Composition helps in reducing the complexity as a collection of different objects will be considered as one object. Three basic properties are used to determine the composition relationships, the first property is configuration, which means whether or not the parts have a functional or structural effect on one another or to the object they are part of. The second property is Homeomerous, which means whether or not the parts are the same kind. The last property is Invariance, which means whether or not the parts can be separated from the whole object. The six ways of composition are: Component-integral object composition (which is the most common composition) , Material-object composition, Portion-object composition, Place-area composition, Member-bunch composition and Member-partnership composition.

<h3>Davis et al. 1993</h3>

<p class="counter">
Davis et al. (1993) focus in their paper on the answer of the question “What is a knowledge representation?”. They believe that the answer can be understood based on five different roles, which knowledge representation plays. The first role is: Knowledge representation is a surrogate, which means that knowledge representation can be an alternative for the thing itself. However, it should be recognised that all representations are inaccurate, and the only and most accurate representation of an object is the object itself. The second role is: A knowledge representation is a set of ontological commitments, which is an answer to the question ”In what terms should I think about the world”. The third role is: Knowledge representation is a fragmentary theory of intelligent reasoning, where the set of all inferences that can be inferred, and the set of recommended inferences are provided. The fourth role: knowledge representation is a medium for efficient computation. The fifth role: Knowledge representation is a medium of human expression. Davis et al.(1993) believe that understanding knowledge representation based on these five roles will have consequences in research and practice.

<h3>Gruber 1995</h3>

<p class="counter">
Gruber (1995) believes that the development of an engineering discipline for the design of ontology is needed in order to create understandable ontologies. Therefore, Gruber(1995) analyses in his paper the design requirements of ontologies, and he provides design criteria for the development of knowledge-share purpose ontologies. The author proposes five design criteria for formal ontologies, these criteria are clarity, coherence, extendibility, minimal encoding bias and minimal ontological commitment. Although the design criteria are not at odds, in some cases, trade-offs need to be made among the criteria. For that purpose, two case studies were considered in this paper to illustrate the way by which the criteria should be applied.
