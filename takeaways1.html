<h1>Takeaways for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge Organization</h3>

<p class="counter">
Resources become more and more over time, and it is time consuming to look for a certain resource between all these resources. Therefore, it is important to organize resources so that time will be saved when looking for something. Knowledge organization systems are there to organize resources by using knowledge representations. Some examples of data organization systems are wikipedia, databases and library catalogs. Some examples of knowledge representations are diagrams, mind maps and database entries. Knowledge representations and machine learning are both subfields of Artificial Intelligence. The difference is that machine learning methods need to use large amounts of data to extract patterns in data in an automatic way, while the knowledge representations use a manual way to structure human knowledge in order to generate an automatic question answering and to get what we are looking for. Persons who should organize knowledge are knowledge representation experts, domain Experts, non-expert users and crowdsourcing workers. It also can be a combination of these persons as it depends on the organizing that should be done. Knowledge organizing can be achieved through following four activities which are selecting and organizing resources, designing resource-based interactions and maintaining resources. However, the way by which data should be organized has to be defined depending on the problem and its context.

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Within nonprofit organizations, a class of workers called â€œvolunteer coordinators'' are responsible for organizing volunteer program tasks related to managing diverse information about volunteers to engage them within the organization. Volunteer coordinators create homebrew databases to satisfy their information management needs, these homebrew databases are created by using multiple systems, namely, personal office applications, email address books, and paper-based databases. As a result of using the homebrew databases, some problems and challenges arise. Such challenges are issues of scale and inaccessibility, duplicated data and time- consuming tasks. The solution which volunteer coordinators seek is to find one information system that can achieve all tasks. Therefore, volunteer coordinators continuously make efforts to restructure their homebrew systems. However, every new homebrew system has its own shortcomings.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter">
Guha et al stated in their article the history of schema.org, the reasons which led to the creation of schema.org and its success factors. Schema.org was created in 2011 by the search engines Bing, Google and Yahoo as the need for structured data increased due to the abundant amounts of data. The support which was provided by third-party tools such as Drupal and wordpress extensions contributed to the success of schema.org. Another factor which contributes to this success is the design decisions that Schema.org depends on, where the design of schema.org aims to facilitate the process of data publishing for webmasters. Some design decisions encouraged webmasters to use the schema.prg such as the syntax. Schema.org allows webmasters to choose the syntax which they prefer from multiple syntaxes. Some other design decisions are polymorphism, entity references, incremental complexity.
