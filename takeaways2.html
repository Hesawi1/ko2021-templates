<h1>Takeaways for Week 2</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Resource Descriptions</h3>

<p class="counter">
Resources should be well described in order to be in the form of an organisable resource. One way to describe resources is tagging. Taggings are vocabularies used to describe an image or video or another resource, but the problem is that tagging does not follow a specific structure as everyone types what they want, to describe something without following a predefined structure. Therefore, taggings are not principled and they are not well categorized. On the other hand, classification is a useful way to describe resources as classification is principled and purposeful. However, classification is always subjective and biased. Moreover, there are different and endless classifications of an object. logic and ontologies are needed when resources are described using classification, where relations and rules are enabled. Lastly, knowledge organization can be done without theories, but there will be limits to be faced.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Shoham 2015</h3>

<p class="counter">
In the 1990s, the AI focus was on logic by using knowledge representations. Over time the AI focus has changed. Nowadays, AI focuses more on machine learning algorithms and statistical methods. Despite the success that machine learning and statistics brought to AI, the author argues that logic and knowledge representation still matter. Shoham (2015) describes the importance of knowledge representation through a personal story about the Timeful company which developed the Personal Time Assistant concept. One of the pillars that this concept depends on is to allow users to represent things which vie for their time. Knowledge representation was the base of that pillar.

<h3>Benson and Karger 2014</h3>

<p class="counter">
This paper provides a full analysis about the use of the Exhibit framework which is a tool that allows end-users, who are not programmers or web developers, to publish interactive data visualizations on the Web. Benson and karger (2014) identified in their study the needs of such end users who want to publish structured data but have not enough programming skills, they found that Exhibit framework meets these needs and offers the opportunity for many to learn programming as well. Exhibit is a javascript-based framework which is simple enough to allow beginners and non-experienced users to make use of its functionality, in addition, it covers the needs of programmers and experienced users.

<h3>Haas et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Haas et al. (2011) proposed in their paper a new method that makes the web search results more interactive, this method is called enhanced search result. The enhanced search results is an extension of the traditional search results, where it is extended with interactive objects such as images, videos and key value pairs that facilitate the searching process. Haas et al. (2011) assessed the effectiveness of the enhanced search results by conducting a user study. They found that users prefer the enhanced search results more than the traditional search results by conducting a comparative study. Moreover, a higher Click-Through Rate (CTR) was obtained by the enhanced search results. CTR is a commonly used tool in online advertising and search engine optimization. They also have shown that enhanced search results are an effective way that provides the users with the relevant content they are searching for.

<h3>Berners-Lee et al. 2001</h3>

<p class="counter">
Bernars-Lee et al. (2001) give in their article a preview of the Semantic Web which is an extension of the Web where information is provided with well-defined meaning. In other words, the Semantic Web will be able to understand the Web content. The authors described how the Semantic Web will give a structure to the content of the Web and provide more interactions between the users and the computers as these computers will be able to display the data and understand it as well. To make computers able to understand, they need structured-data, therefore,  knowledge representation is a tool that can enable the reasoning functionality of computers. XML and RDF aer two of the crucial technologies to develop the Semantic Web, where XML enables the user to add arbitrary structures to their documents. While RDF can be used to express the meaning through a set of triples.
