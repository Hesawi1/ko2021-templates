<h1>Takeaways for Week 7</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Smart, Connected and Open Audio-Visual Content</h3>

<p class="counter">
The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision is an organization whose aim is to collect and archive audio-visual content and make this content available and accessible for as many different users as possible. This content comes from the new digital content, and the old material which is not digital and needs to be digitized. The content included in the NISV is smart, connected and open. Firstly, the NISV archive is a smart archive which can be partly read by machines for some purposes (such as searching for a specific material). While this archive is connected as it makes use of the Semantic Web technologies in order to connect its content to other external resources. Lastly, The archive of the NISV is open as it is accessible for different and many users, they can reuse it in different and creative ways with respect to some constraints.

<h3>Knowledge Maintenance and Evaluation</h3>

<p class="counter">
In order to evaluate a knowledge model or system, different aspects could be evaluated by applying different evaluation models. However, a reliable evaluation should focus on one aspect at a time. There are two types of evaluation: system evaluation and model evaluation. Some aspects that can be evaluated when evaluating a knowledge system are the system efficiency and performance, subjective feelings of users, and the understandability of the knowledge included in the system. Moreover, other aspects that can be evaluated in a system are the ease and accuracy which allow users to add new knowledge, and also the amount of time saved by using the system. While aspects that can be evaluated when evaluating a model ( for example an ontology) are the semantic well-formedness, the semantic consistency, and checking manually the reasoning results.  </p>
